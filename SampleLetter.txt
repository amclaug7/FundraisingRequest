Distinguished Sir or Madam,

    Greetings oh mighty one, may your highness please forgive me that I, scum of the earth, should dare approach your
sublime presence with my feeble concerns, but may I request, as insignificant and unworthy as it is, that you look upon
this speck of dust and hear my plea. In that great hall of virtue, held in such esteem, the Delaware House of
Representatives, a bill is up for debate called Proposition 611, which would earmark money for students needing
financial assistance while taking college courses. By your grace, with your great power, you can assist those that
need it the most, and bless a needy person with your great countenance. Also the school might name something after you
i dunno.

Thank You
